            <p>Jewellery manufacturing requires much skill and time to get it right. 
            Its an art form that needs the combination of technique and concentration to stroke the metal in a precise way to give it the finish needed.
             Intricate designs could sometimes take months to even years to perfect,
              which is why designer jewellery incorporating heavy designs with foliage and minute details come at a price.</p>

            <p>Back in the day jewellery was made entirely by hand, metals were moulded to shape and the setting of gemstones was done painstakingly by hand. 
            These days with the advancements in technology, 
            bench jewellers and artisans are equipped with multiple machines and technologies to help them craft each one of their masterpieces which in turn reduces the turnaround time of a single piece.</p>

            <p>Hand made jewellery is made even to this date. The Karigars as they are known in India make an entire piece of jewellery by hand with little help from modern day techniques, 
            the perfect amalgamation of the old and the new. 
            They sit patiently moulding each gold bar from a bar to the final form by constantly heating and cooling, which gradually gives shape to the metal.</p>
